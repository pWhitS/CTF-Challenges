Exploitation Challenge
=============

<b>Challenge:</b>

The ip address and port number of a remote application was given. Using netcat to create a connection it returned a message saying 'Good Luck!!!'. Upon entering an arbitrary string and sending it to the application, it returned the message 'the value is unchanged'.

		~$ nc 123.456.78.910 12345
		Exploitation challenge...Good Luck!!!
		fdsa
		The value is unchanged

<b>Initial Ideas:</b>

1. Buffer overflow: change the value in memory
2. Buffer overflow: load tcp shellcode, alter the return address to point at the shellcode, find the key.

<b>Solution:</b>

<i> Solution script: exploitation.py </i>
<i> Binary file: rExploit </i>

1. Dissasemble rExploit with IDA pro and reverse engineer the binary. 
2. The function handling the user's input has its stack's return address pointed at a 'lose fucntion'
3. Found a win fucntion in the binary. This function is never executed under normal circumstances. 
4. Overwrite the return address to point at the 'win function'
5. The 'win function' grabs the key from a file and sends it over the network.
